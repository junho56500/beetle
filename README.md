### Description>
- Beetle is space to research and develop ML based modules for detection of tiny object and autonomous driving to destination 
- Target product is holistic autonomous infrastructure to provide convenient service on atheltic club like recording of trajectory of ball to analyze pattern of players and utlize them to imporve atheletic performance

### Contents>
## Study
- c++ : c++ base code for basic and advanced algorithm such as serching, order, greedy, hash table, memory pool and algorightm for estimation, fusion and object oriented based design pattern, class. Also they can be used libararies for the project
- cs231n : summary of Stanford University lectures
- pytorch : pytorch based deep learning lectures 

## Project
- av_arch : architectures
- smart caddy : 
    - object detection of tiny, fast ball
    - av for destination
    - localization libs
    - utils for ML logics
